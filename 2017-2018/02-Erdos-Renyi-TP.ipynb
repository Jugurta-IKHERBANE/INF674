Then, any individual that is infected at some step is contagious during one step and is (definitely) removed at the next step. While it is contagious, this individual can infect any other susceptible individual independently at random with probability $p$. Hence, at the end of any step $t \\ge 1$, the individuals that were infected at the end of step $t-1$ are removed, the susceptible individuals of step $t-1$ that were infected during step $t$ become infected, and the others remain susceptible.\n",
