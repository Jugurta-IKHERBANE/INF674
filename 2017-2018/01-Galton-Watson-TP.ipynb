    "To start the course, we propose to investigate the **Galton-Watson process**.\n",
    "This process was introduced to depict the propagation of some feature (family surname, DNA) through generations, and in particular to estimate its probability of extinction.\n",
    "\n",
    "A Galton-Watson process can be represented as a (directed) random tree. It is built generation by generation as follows. At generation $0$, there is a single individual, the ancestor of the population, represented by the tree *root*. Starting from this, each individual from a given generation $ i $ gives birth to a certain number of individual at generation $ i+1 $, represented by its direct successors in the tree.\n",
    "\n",
    "The unique parameter of the process is the distribution of the number of children of each node. Specifically, we assume that the number of children of a node is independent from the other nodes, drawn according to some given distribution $(p_k)_{k\\in \\mathbb{N}}$ (s.t. $\\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty} p_k = 1$). We let $\\mu$ denote the average number of children, supposed finite:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\mu =  \\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty} k p_k <+\\infty.\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that there are multiple ways to explore the tree. For example:\n",
    "- **Generation by generation**: This is the view we presented above. We call $ G_i $ the random variable which counts the number of nodes at generation $ i $.\n",
    "- **Active node by active node**: The nodes are visited one by one to decide on their number of offsprings. We keep track of the number of nodes which are *active* in the sense that we have discovered them but we have not drawn their number of offsprings yet. As long as there are active nodes, we can perform a *termination* which consists in desactivating a node, drawing the number of its children according to $(p_k)_{k \\in \\mathbb{N}}$ and adding these children (if any) to the set of active nodes. We call $ X_t $ the number of active nodes after $ t $ terminations, with the convention that $X_0 = 1$. Observe that $(X_t)_{t \\in \\mathbb{N}}$ defines a Markov process which is similar to a birth-and-death process, except that state $0$ is absorbing.\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of the practical is to play with the two views to understand Galton-Watson processes.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you want to deepen your theoretical knowledge of this process, you can read Chapter 1 from the book [Epidemics and Rumours in Complex Networks][massoulie] (which is **not** mandatory).\n",
