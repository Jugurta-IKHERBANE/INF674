    "To start the course, we propose to investigate the Galton-Watson process. If you want to deepen your theoretical knowledge of Galton-Watson processes, you can read Chapter 1 from the book [Epidemics and Rumours in Complex Networks][massoulie] (this is **not** mandatory).\n",

    "The goal of the process is to depict the propagation of some feature (family surname, DNA) through generations, and in particular to estimate the probability of extinction.\n",
    "\n",
    "The process builds a tree as follows: We start with one node (the $0th$ generation, patient $ 0 $), the tree *root*. Each node from a given generation $ i $ will give birth to a certain number of nodes from generation $ i+1 $. The number of children nodes $ k $ is drawn i.i.d. according to some given distribution $(p_k)_{k\\in \\mathbb{N}}$ s.t. $\\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty} p_k = 1$. We call $\\mu$ the average number of children, supposed finite: $\\mu =  \\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty} k p_k <+\\infty$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that there is multiple ways to build evolution of the tree. For example:\n",
    "- Generation by generation: we then can call $ G_i $ the random variable that express the number of nodes for generation $ i $.\n",
    "- Active node by active node: you keep in mind the number of nodes for which you have not decided the number of offsprings. As long as it is not empty, you can perform a *termination* (also called *activation* in previous editions of this course): remove one active node and add new ones according to $(p_k)_{k\\in \\mathbb{N}}$. We call $ X_t $ the number of active nodes after $ t $ terminations.\n",

    "The goal of the present is to play with the two views to understand GW."
